# codemirror-modern-search-replace
A more user friendly version of Codemirror's built in search addon. 

## Notable Changes
- The search panel is replaced with a search/replace panel
- This panel is persistent by default (won't close automatically on blur or enter press)
- Buttons for the most common navigations, instead of memorizing the old hotkey scheme.

Note: Since I'm using this as part of a side project, this particular version has a Bootstrap 4 dependency for some of the button icons. I've also gone with strictly CommonJS for the imports/exports.

This will be cleaned up and released on NPM shortly for easy use in other projects.
