# codemirror-modern-search-replace
A more user friendly version of Codemirror's built in search addon. 
Note: Since I'm using this as part of a side project, this particular version has a Bootstrap 4 dependency for some of the button icons. I've also gone with strictly CommonJS for the imports/exports.
This will be cleaned up and released on NPM shortly for easy use in other projects.
